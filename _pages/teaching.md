Besides sharing knowledge with new generations of computer scientists,
we value the insights and view of the continuously renewing student body on our disciplines.
Further, we enjoy close research collaboration with motivated students,
often performed as a thesis!

<!-- We invite you to join our [courses](#courses),
to write a [thesis](#theses) with us or to [join us as a PhD student]({{ '/open-positions' | relative_url }}). -->
