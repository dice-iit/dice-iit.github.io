This programme aims to allow young researchers, graduates, and students to explore research directions and develop cutting-edge technological solutions that address business needs in the Fintech domain using AI.
The initiative was distinguished with the Gold Award in the “Business & Academic Institutions Cooperation” category at the Hellenic Responsible Business Awards 2022, organized by Boussias Media.
Demokritos – Qualco Fellowship programme

One of the main pillars of this programme is to support postgraduate researchers in attaining knowledge in the field of FinTech through their research in domains that Demokritos and QUALCO are active in. The programme supports an  R&D team consisting of one postdoctoral fellow and two PhD researchers to conduct their research, acquire new skills, and develop their understanding of challenges in FinTech. They are currently working on utilizing unstructured, semi-structured, and fully structured data to empower fintech analysis and advance AI-driven innovation in the FinTech sector.

Another pillar is to support Master students in putting academic knowledge into business practice. Therefore 5 students from the MSc in Data Science conducted their theses on topics that were real business challenges of QUALCO under the scientific and business supervision of both organisations.

The research directions were derived through a series of workshops conducted by QUALCO internally as well as jointly with Demokritos researchers. The outcome of the workshops was a series of business challenges which were prioritised and mapped into cutting-edge research topics.
