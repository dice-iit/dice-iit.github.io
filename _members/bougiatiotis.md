I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and my primary focus is data science and machine learning. I hold a research associate position with the Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications of the National Center for Scientific Research “Demokritos”, where I am involved in international projects.

I work along the Software and Knowledge Engineering Laboratory and I conduct research under the guidance of Dr. Georgios Paliouras. I am mostly interested in machine learning, data mining and NLP. Currently, my focus is graph neural networks and their applications on heterogenous/multi-relational graphs, mainly on bio-related data.

I hold a Diploma (5-years combined B.Sc. and M.Sc.) from the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.
